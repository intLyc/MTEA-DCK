## Note

The MTO-Platform (MToP) has incorporated the relevant algorithm at *"[MTO/Algorithms/Multi-objective Multi-task/Multi-population/MTEA-DCK/MTEA_DCK.m](https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform/blob/master/MTO/Algorithms/Multi-objective%20Multi-task/Multi-population/MTEA-DCK/MTEA_DCK.m)"* and provides convenient utility functions. We highly recommend using it for code running. [https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform](https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform)
